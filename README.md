Project 1
```
Brief Description:
The point of this script is to show you how much free space/space that you have left on your Hard Drive as well as it tells you the time at the point of execution.  For my Virtual Machine, the result should be “Your C drive has 15.11 GB left and this was conducted at (Insert whenever the script is ran).”

Instructions on how to run Project 1.ps1:

Download and open the Project 1.ps1 file in PowerShell ISE.

Click the “Run Script (F5)” button (shown b y a green play button).

You will get a line of text in the Console saying “Your C drive has X GB left and this was conducted at Y.” X being the amount of space in GB left and y being the time you execute the script.

Another way you could run it is by downloading the file.

Open PowerShell.

Navigating to the directory that you put Project 1.ps1 in and typing “& ‘.\Project 1.ps1’”.

Click enter and you will the results of "Your C drive has X GB left and this was conducted at Y."

Project 2
```
Brief Description:
The point of this script is to show you how many files are more than 200 MB and emails you the names of the files and size (in bytes). For my virtual machine, the result is 3 files that are above 200 MB.

Instructions on how to run Project2.ps1:

Download the Project2.ps1 from github and open it in Powershell ISE.

Change the following fields as needed:
-In line 2, the "c:\" can be changed for whatever drive you want to check for files bigger than 200MB.
-In line 5, the To recipient needs to be changed for an email address that you can access.

Once the fields are converted, run the script, and enter the google credentials you have.

If an error is thrown saying "The SMTP server requires a secure connection...," then go to your google account, the security tab, look for Less secure app access, and toggle the button to on.

Rerun the script, enter the credentials, and verify that no error gets thrown.
When the script is finished it will say that the email is sent,then check the email you put as the To recipient.

Verify that the email was sent and contains files that are bigger than 200MB.

Project 3
```
Brief Description:
The point of this javascript program is to simulate snake being run through a index.html and javascript code. I wanted to do something more dynamic for the last project seeing as my first two projects were very satis in the sense that it had no user input whether being typed or manipulated via the keyboard.

Instructions on how to run Project 3:

Download all files from the project 3 folder and put them all in the same folder.

Once all the files are downloaded you can cutomize how big you want the canvas to be in both the index.html file and in the snake.js file. (This is optional)

Once you have your canvas the size that you want it to be open the index.html file in your web browser. I would recommend right-clicking on the file an then click open with and select which browser you want to play it on.

Once the browser is selected you will be able to play the game using your arrow keys. 

When you collide into yourself or complete the game (if you can fill the entire canvas) then a game over will be issued.

But most importantly

HAVE FUN!
